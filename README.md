# Web Development Project 5 - *Recipe Finder*

Submitted by: **Jack Winkler**

This web app: **This app connects to the spoonacular API to find recipes for the user, and allows them to filter by servings and prep time.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - *Mode Cuisine, Average Minutes, Max Servings*
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**

## Notes

It was challenging to explore the API documentation and determine how to access different attributes. It was also challenging to pass the data as props across different components.
